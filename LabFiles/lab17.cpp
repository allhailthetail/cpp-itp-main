Pre-Lab Questions:

1.  A class constructor is a unique class member function that is
    automatically called when a class is 'instantiated.'
2.  Constructors are different because they must have the same name as
    the class they are assigned to, and constructors have no
    return type.
3.  Declaring things inside a class as public is necessary when those items
    will be used outside the class.  Likewise, classes keep all items
    private, unless specified otherwise.  In this way, data encapsulation
    makes object-oriented programming so powerful.
